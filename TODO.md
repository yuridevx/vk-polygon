It's unknown how credentials are managed.

* User joined social platform
* User added personal credentials to organisation
* User added group credentials to organisation
* User leaves organisation
What happens to credentials ? They are removed!
What if they are only working credentials for particular block to function ?

What happens if

* Application is added to the group?
* 2 different users give access to group
    * What if their roles are different
    
    
Most likely when you reauthenticate with new scope the token is updated
